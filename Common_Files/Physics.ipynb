    "**In developing CFD simulation for a fluid mechanics problem understanding the general physics and fundamental theory of the problem is extremely important. This knowledge would provide user the ability to make logical decision about the geometry of CFD domain, choice of proper boundary conditions and numerical models for the CFD simulation setup. Furthermore, user will have a general big picture of the expected results from simulation. These knowledges and abilities form the foundation for a successful and accurate implementation and possibly validation of the CFD simulation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words understanding physics and theory of problem before developing a CFD simulation can be thought of turning on a flash light prior to taking any step in a completely dark room. Hence, let's review the fundamental physics and theory behind the problem of \"[insert the topic of problem here]\" as the first step for development and validation of CFD simulation for the problem of < insert the title of the problem > :**\n",

    "# General Recommended Structure for Writing Physics File\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the recommended general structure to develop the Physics file for the flow of interest. Please note that we are always open to new ideas and modifying the structure below. Thus, do not limit yourself to the following structure and feel free to implement your suggestion and changes. We can modify this structure based on new feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1- Start with a sketch of the flow field and briefly discuss the general physics of the flow field.\n",
    "#### 2- Present and discuss terms of the most generic form of used governing equation for simulating the flow field.\n",
    "#### 3- State and explain all the physical assumptions and simplifications to develop the specific equations for the flow field.\n",
    "#### 4- Derive and state the most important equations of variable(s) of interest for the flow field (step-by-step derivation is not recommended).\n",
    "#### 5- Explain the physics behind the important flow field dimensional or non-dimensional variable(s) and show available experimental or other valid numerical results for their trend.\n",
    "#### 6- Discuss how the CFD simulation results would be compared against these results later in the post-processing and validation step.\n",
    "#### 7- Cite the source(s) that you have used for writing the content of your Physics file considering the copy right rules.  Make sure to cite the sources you use or refer to within the body of the text as well as in the end!\n",
