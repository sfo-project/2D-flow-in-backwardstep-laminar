    "# CFD Domain's Creation & Discretization\n",
    "\n",
    "< copy and paste the two below paragraphs on top of your Domain file. >\n",
    "\n",
    "** The next step for developing the CFD simulation for a case study, after the review of physics and theory behind the problem of interest, is to create the CFD/Computational domain. This CFD domain will first be created and then discretized into small finite elements (2D) or finite volumes (3D). The flow field's governing equations are then solved numerically inside these finite elements or volumes via an iterative process till a converged solution inside the entire CFD domain is obtained. It should be highlighted that this section provides the most generic steps and techniques to create and discretize the CFD domain. Users can implement these steps/techniques in the mesher of their choice or download the pre-generated * .msh file from the \"Simulation_Src\" folder. **\n",

    "# General Recommended Structure for Writing Domain File\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the recommended general structure to develop the Domain file for the flow of interest. Please note that we are always open to new ideas and modifying the structure below. Thus, do not limit yourself to the following structure and feel free to implement your suggestion and changes. We can modify this structure based on new feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1- Start with explanation of how most basic and simple geometrical shapes (i.e. circle, cylinder andt etc.) form the raw geometry of the CFD domain.\n",
    "#### 2- Present and discuss the fundamental CAD techniques and operations (i.e. boolean operations) used to create the raw geometry of the CFD domain and present descriptive figure(s) for your steps.\n",
    "#### 3- Present and discuss the fundamental discretization/meshing techniques you plan to use to create discretize the CFD domain and present steps with figure(s). Note to use most fundamental mesh technique (e.g. meshing edges) as much as possible. Avoid blind meshing techniques! \n",
    "#### 4- Provide futuristic ideas and potential changes for mesh refinement, due to change of Reynolds number, and discuss how your techniques make this task as smooth as possible.\n",
    "#### 5- Possibly link the importance of the mesh resolution with physics of the flow field discussed in Physics section. Discuss how complex flow field require refined mesh areas and simple flow field can be modeled with low mesh resolution. Explain how your meshing techniques consider this important fact.\n",
    "#### 6- Discuss the final steps to create the surface or volume mesh based on the generated fundamental mesh (i.e. edge or surfaces). Visualize the final mesh with a clear picture.\n",
    "#### 7- Discuss procedure(s) to check the quality of the mesh.\n",
    "#### 8- Cite the source(s) that you have used for writing the content of your Domain file considering the copy right rules.  Make sure to cite the sources you use or refer to within the body of the text as well as in the end!\n",
