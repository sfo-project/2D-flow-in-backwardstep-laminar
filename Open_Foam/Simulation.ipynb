    "# CFD Simulation Case Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**The created CFD domain is now read into the CFD package of interest to setup the CFD simulation. It should be noted that the current tutorial has a significant difference compared to other available CFD tutorials online! This tutorial is structured and developed based on a generic and methodological approach to set up a CFD simulation. The first principals and reasonings for each setting is discussed at each step. Potential alterations and modifications to perform similar analysis for different flow conditions are also addressed and discussed. Hence, in the end user will have the capability of applying potential modifications, improvements or extending the application of the current CFD simulation to a more complex problem of interest, rather than having a one time successful run of a specific simulation with specific and strictly pre-defined boundary conditions.**\n",

    "## Setting up a CFD simulation has following four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**0. Import the CFD Domain into Solver:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The previously generated CFD domain, fully explained in the Domain section, will be imported properly into the CFD solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the physics of the flow field user will select required model/s to simulate the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "User will define the physical and thermodynamical properties of the working fluid/s and solid/s in the problem.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary & Zone Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the governing equations of the flow (i.e. system of partial differential equations) requires well-defined boundary conditions within the CFD domain. These conditions are selected and defined in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Setup Solution Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In CFD simulations the governing equations of the flow are solve numerically. Based on the physics of the problem appropriate numerical schemes and solution methods are selected at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section the details for the above-mentioned four steps of the CFD simulation setup process for the case study of **2D Laminar Flow in a Channel with a Backward Facing Step** are explained in great details. As a general guideline, to setup a CFD simulation in OpenFoam it is recommended to start with files from one of the provided default tutorials in OpenFoam located in `OpenFoam/run/tutorials`. Users should find appropriate tutorial such that the general physics of the chosen tutorial is close to the problem of interest of users. This way, the majority of the required physical settings are pre-set and the others can be changed/modified accordingly. For example for the problem of **2D Laminar Flow in a Channel with a Backward Facing Step** the tutorial of **2D over an airfoil** located at `OpenFoam/run/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/airFoil2D` is used. Using the previously developed file, the above-mentioned four steps for CFD simulation development is done via editing the corresponding files, where the settings are defined and are located in the main working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**0. Importing the Created CFD Domain into Solver:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The official mesh generator for OpenFoam is called <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">blockMesh</span>. This is a command base mesher software. Users write/edit the desired settings to generate and discretize the geometry of CFD domain in a dictionary file (i.e. a text file) named <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">blockMeshDict</span> located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\constant\\\\polyMesh</span> inside the main working directory. In simple words the file is the dictionary, where the geometry and discretization process of it are fully defined. Once edits of `blockMeshDict` file are completed then it is compiled via the command <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">blockMesh</span>. This will generate multiple required files, that include the details of the discretized CFD domain for the use of OpenFoam solver in the directory of the `blockMeshDict` file. Readers can read more about the `blockMesh` utility [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/blockmesh/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, OpenFoam has various built-in commands that allow it's users to convert their previously generated CFD domain in different mesher packages into the readable format for the OpenFoam. A list of these commands can be found [here](http://www.openfoam.org/features/mesh-conversion.php). In this tutorial this alternative approach is used to convert the previously generated CFD domain with * .msh format to the readable format in OpenFoam. In order to perform this process users put the * .msh file of the previously generated CFD domain in the main working directory and use the command <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fluentMeshToFoam</span> with the name of the mesh file after the command to perform the mesh conversion process (i.e. <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fluentMeshtoFoam [file name]. msh</span>). This will generate multiple required files, that include the details of the discretized CFD domain for the use of OpenFoam in the working directory. Users should make sure that the generated report contains no error or problem. The details of the previously generated CFD domain in * .msh format are fully explained in the Domain (see <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Common_Files -> Domain</span>) part of this tutorial.\n",

    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumption in the problem of flow in a channel with a backward facing step is that the free stream flow is uniform/steady and evolution of the flow within the domain is steady. Therefore, the steady model is chosen to develop this CFD simulation. This along with other numerical schemes settings are set in a dictionary file called \"fvSchemes\" located at `\\system` folder. To set the solver to be steady users define `Steadystate` for the `ddtSchemes` and the rest of the settings will remain unchanged:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "ddtSchemes\n",
    "{\n",
    "    default         Steadystate;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In cases where the flow properties rapidly changes with respect to time, such as cases where the Reynolds number, based on channel's height (as the length scale), is greater than the critical value of 1200 in which flow will show signs of unsteadiness the appropriate Transient model should be chosen in this step. Various available time schemes along with other implementable option within \"fvSchemes\" dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/fvschemes/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current problem the focus is to investigate formation and length of laminar recirculation region right after the backward facing step. The appropriate model for this problem is <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">laminar</span> is set in a dictionary file called `turbulenceProperties` located at `\\constant` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",

    "\n",
    "turbulence      off;\n",
    "\n",
    "printCoeffs     off;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the critical Reynolds number for turbulent flows in a channel with backward facing step is about $1200$. In cases that the Reynolds number, based on the channel height (as the length scale), is greater than this critical value the appropriate turbulent model should be selected at this step. Various available turbulence models along with other options within `turbulenceProperties` dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/turbulence/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of working fluid is problem dependent. In the absence of obligations to define a specific working fluid such as air or water, which is not the case for this case study, it is suggested that the users define the working fluid such that the important non-dimensional groups of interest, such as Reynolds number in this problem, is matched the desired flow conditions. This strategy removes the uncertainty in the choice of the working fluid and will solidify the bases for expected physical observations. The material properties in OpenFoam can be defined in a dictionary file `transportPropertise` located in `constant` folder. In this file the material is set to be `Newtonian` fluid with a defined kinematic viscosity **\\nu**. It should be noted that the numbers in the [] set the dimension of the flow field variable of interest and the other number sets it's value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "transportModel  Newtonian;\n",
    "\n",
    "nu              nu [ 0 2 -1 0 0 0 0 ] 1.461E-5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the current case study, since the numerical solution of the CFD simulations will be validated later against the developed experiment by [Armaly et. al.](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=380534&fileId=S0022112083002839), the working fluid in simulations is defined to match the working fluid in the experiment. As discussed earlier in the Physics section Reynolds number of this flow field is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Re = \\frac{UD}{\\nu} = \\frac{U(2h)}{\\nu}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formulation $h=0.0052~[m]$ is the height of the channel's entrance (i.e. length scale of the flow) and $\\nu = 1.461E-5~[\\frac{m^2}{s}]$ is the kinematic viscosity of air, as the working fluid, in standard conditions. To match the known Reynolds number ($Re$) for different operating conditions of the [Armaly et. al.](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=380534&fileId=S0022112083002839) experiment, the flow velocity $U$ can be calculated and imposed as the boundary condition (will be explained in the next step). Alternatives for the transport models along with other options to define working fluid within `transportPropertise` dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/transport-rheology/#x40-2210007.3.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary and Zone Conditions:**   \n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenFoam the type of boundaries within the CFD domain are defined in the `boundary` file located at `\\constant\\polyMesh`. Whether the users use blockMesh or the convert command to create the CFD domain and discretize the `boundary` file will be created in this process. Furthermore values for the field variables, such as velocity **U** and pressure **p**, at these boundaries are set in `U` and `p` files located at `0` folder located in the working directory respectively. The `0` folder includes the values of the field variables at boundaries for the time `t=0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier in the CFD domain's creation and discretization section, the CFD domain has five faces as boundaries. The boundary and zone conditions settings to develop CFD simulation for **2D Laminar Flow in a Channel with a Backward Facing Step** case in OpenFoam are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inlet:** The flow enters from the inlet face of the CFD domain with constant velocity and uniform atmospheric pressure (i.e. zero gauge pressure).

    "**top_wall, bottom_wall_inlet & bottom_wall_outlet:** The CFD domain is bounded via three surfaces on top and bottom named after their location within the domain as **top** and **bottom** respectively. These three surfaces will interact with the flow field based on no-slip wall boundary conditions. Meaning the the velocity of fluid elements along these walls will be equal to zero and can not slip along the wall region.
